      "question": "Why did you start making video manuals at TogoTV?",
      "answer": "At the beginning of the service, we hypothesized that with a book-like style of screen captures and explanatory text, beginners might not be able to understand the 'line spacing' of the operations. So, we started to create a video manual that would record the whole thing and add explanatory text each time, which would be easier for beginners to understand."
